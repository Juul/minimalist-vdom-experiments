How does react handle component scope e.g. for refs?



Base preact has no string refs. E.g. <input type="text" ref="name" /> but it is deprecated in React anyway. They are available through `preact-compat`.


What's the preact API for .mount() and .unmount() ? We need to handle that too.

What about events? Will `onclick={this.func}` work like it does in preact?

# Main

Write our own h() function.

It should be similar to preact's but output the same kind of stuff as 'virtual-dom/h' so we can use that toolchain.

The only difference should be that if it has a custom name then it should not call that function, simply save it.

Then when the patch if applied to the actual DOM (the render) we need a custom hook to instantiate the component and handle mount, unmount, etc:

* componentWillMount 	before the component gets mounted to the DOM
* componentDidMount 	after the component gets mounted to the DOM
* componentWillUnmount 	prior to removal from the DOM
* componentWillReceiveProps 	before new props get accepted
* shouldComponentUpdate 	before render(). Return false to skip render
* componentWillUpdate 	before render()
* componentDidUpdate 	after render()
